Weather 247

## Description

This project is a weather reports application built with Next.js 13.4, Typescript, Stepzen, and Tailwind CSS. It allows users to obtain up-to-date weather information for different locations.

The application fetches weather data from a reliable source and provides users with a user-friendly interface to view and interact with the data. Users can search for weather reports by location, and the application displays the current weather conditions, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other relevant details.
